## PROJECT-1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

**Objective:** Design a classification model that predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets in the given dataset.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the text data in the 'text' column (e.g., remove special characters, stopwords, and perform tokenization).
   - Convert the sentiment labels (0, 2, 4) to (negative, neutral, positive).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

3. **Model Building:**
   - Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or a neural network).
   - Train the model on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Fine-tuning and Optimization:**
   - Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance (e.g., grid search or random search).

## PROJECT-2: Ratings of Guvi Courses

**Objective:** Design a regression model to predict the ratings given by learners to Guvi courses.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing data (if any).
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., course level and subject) into numerical format.
   - Normalize numerical features if necessary.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Choose a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the regression model on the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

4. **Fine-tuning and Optimization:**
   - Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.

## PROJECT-3: Instagram Influencers

**Objective:** Analyze and answer questions based on the given dataset of Instagram influencers.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Answer the provided questions, including correlation analysis, frequency distributions, and country-wise counts of influencers.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to illustrate relationships between features and answer the questions.

4. **Summary:**
   - Summarize the findings and provide insights based on the analysis.

## PROJECT-4: Image Classification (Cats vs. Dogs)

**Objective:** Design a binary classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Download and preprocess the image dataset.
   - Resize images to a consistent size.
   - Normalize pixel values.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Feature Extraction (Optional):**
   - Use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or Inception) to extract features from images.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Build a binary image classification model using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
   - Train the model on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Fine-tuning and Optimization:**
   - Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, changing architectures, or using techniques like data augmentation.
